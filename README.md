中文说明: https://github.com/Bush2021/chrome_plus/blob/main/README_CN.md

# Features
* Double-click to close tabs.
* Preserve the last tab (prevents the browser from closing when the last tab is closed; clicking the 'X' won't work).
* Mouse hover to scroll the tab bar.
* Right-click and scroll the tab bar.
* Portable design: the program is placed in the App directory, and data is stored in the Data directory (incompatible with the original data; you can reinstall the system or change computers without losing data).
* Remove update error warnings (since it's a green version without automatic update functionality).

# Download
Built and released automatically using GitHub Actions. Download link: https://github.com//actions/ or https://github.com/Bush2021/chrome_plus/releases/.

# Installation
Place the DLL together with chrome.exe

# Compatibility
* All browsers based on the latest stable branches of Chromium are theoretically supported.
* Browsers such as Microsoft Edge are known to require injection of DLL to use. See: https://github.com/Bush2021/chrome_plus/blob/main/setdll/.
